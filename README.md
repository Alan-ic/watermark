Watermark
==========

The code embeds a digital watermark into PDF files and extracts them. The code currently requires 3rd party libraries: OpenCV, Tesseract, Matlab.

Deployment
----------
The deployment instructions are for MacOS.

* For a guide on how to set up OpenCV see: [link](https://www.marginallyclever.com/2015/10/install-opencv-3-0-0-java-eclipse-osx-10-10-1/)
* For calling Matlab function you need Matlab 2016b or newer. To build the project see: [link](https://de.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_external/setup-environment.html)

Use
---
You can find the code for embedding and extracting the watermark in separate packages along with a package that is used for testing.
